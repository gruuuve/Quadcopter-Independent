# Quadcopter-Independent
Repository to showcase photos of a quadcopter I put together to fly for fun 

In top_view it may be noted my personal adaptation to having a counter tapped cap to hold down the propeller, which is electrical tape and a tight zip tie because I was impatient to wait for shipping and the caps like to unscrew during a crash (there have been plenty, I have learned this is a pretty durable build)

Parts list:
Crazepony CC3D OpenFlight Flight Controller for QAV250
Hobbymate Quadcopter Kit Motor ESC Combo (2 CW, 2 CCW)
Hobbymate BLHeli-12A-ESC Speed Controllers (x4)
Tattu LiPo Battery Pack 1300mAH 11.1V
LHI LED strip (for side orientation)
CrazePony Martian II Carbon Fiber Frame

*Video of flying to be uploaded soon

note: learning to fly it is a much different curve than learning to build it
